they've sped up to the point where they provoke
the punchline before they have told the joke
Plenty of desperation to be seen
staring at the television screen
they've sped up to the point where they provoke you
to tell the fucking punchline 
before you have to told the joke
sorry sunshine it doesn't exist
it wasn't in the top 100 list
and it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told you but you were dying for it
saw it and she grabbed it 
and it wasn't what it seemed 
the kids all dream of making it 
whatever that means
another variation on a theme
a tangle on the television and the magazine
do you reckon that they do it for a joke
that says that we are defenders
of any poser o professional pretender around
when did your list
replace the twist and turn like a fist
replace a kiss
don't concern us with your bollocks
i don't want your prayer
save it for the morning after
